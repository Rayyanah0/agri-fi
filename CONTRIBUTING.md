## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- npm >= 10
- Docker + Docker Compose
- A [Stellar testnet](https://laboratory.stellar.org/) account (for Stellar-related work)

---

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agri-fund/agri-fi.git
cd agric-onchain

# Backend
cd backend && npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 2. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL on port `5432` and RabbitMQ on port `5672` (management UI at `http://localhost:15672`, credentials: `guest/guest`).

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Fill in the required values — see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below.

### 4. Run migrations

```bash
cd backend
npm run migration:run
```

---

## Running the Project

```bash
# Backend (port 3001)
cd backend && npm run start:dev

# Frontend (port 3000)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

For Stellar work, generate a testnet keypair at https://laboratory.stellar.org and fund it via [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org).

### Stellar CI testnet key

Repository CI expects a funded Stellar testnet secret named `STELLAR_PLATFORM_SECRET_TESTNET` in GitHub Actions secrets. Use a dedicated testnet-only keypair and keep it funded with Friendbot so Stellar-dependent integration tests can create escrow accounts and submit transactions without falling back to an unfunded random account.

When the secret is not configured, CI sets `STELLAR_INTEGRATION_TESTS=false` and logs a notice. Any test that requires Stellar testnet access should check that flag and skip itself when the flag is false. Unit tests that mock Stellar behavior still run normally.

### Frontend env vars

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                    | Required             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Base URL of the backend the frontend talks to (e.g. `http://localhost:3001` for local dev). Baked into the client bundle at `next build` time. | yes for `next build` |

The marketplace pages (`src/app/marketplace/**`) are rendered on demand (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) so `pnpm run build` does not require a reachable backend. If you add new server components that fetch from the API, either mark them `force-dynamic` or wrap the fetch in `try/catch` so the build can continue on transient failures.

---

## Database Migrations

Migrations live in `backend/src/database/migrations/`. TypeORM is configured with `synchronize: false` — always use migrations for schema changes.

For complete authoring conventions, RLS security requirements, zero-downtime guidelines, and rollback verification, consult the [Migration Developer Guide](docs/development/migrations.md).

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
npm run migration:run

# Revert the last migration
npm run migration:revert

# Generate a new migration (after editing entities)
npm run typeorm migration:generate -- -d src/database/data-source.ts src/database/migrations/YourMigrationName
```

Migration file naming convention: `{timestamp}-{PascalCaseName}.ts`

### Index Review Guidelines

**Important**: New query patterns require index review to prevent performance degradation as tables grow.

- **Before adding new queries**: Consider if they need indexes, especially for `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses
- **Composite indexes**: Create for multi-column filters (e.g., `(trade_deal_id, status)` for investment availability queries)
- **Foreign key indexes**: Ensure all foreign key columns have indexes for efficient joins
- **Pessimistic locks**: Queries under `pessimistic_write` locks must use indexes to avoid full table scans
- **Test with EXPLAIN ANALYZE**: Verify queries use index scans, not sequential scans

When in doubt, add the index — PostgreSQL query planner will choose the most efficient execution path.

---

## Testing

For an end-to-end breakdown of test types, commands, fixtures, and CI-gated requirements, see the [Testing Strategy Overview](docs/testing/README.md).

The backend uses **Jest** for unit/integration tests and **fast-check** for property-based tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
cd backend && npm test

# Run a specific test file
npm test src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:cov
```

### Guidelines

- Unit tests go in `*.spec.ts` files co-located with the source file they test.
- Property-based tests use `fast-check` and must run a minimum of 100 iterations.
- Each property test must include a comment referencing its spec property:
  ```ts
  // Feature: agric-onchain-finance, Property 1: token_count = floor(total_value / 100)
  ```
- Do not use mocks to make tests pass — tests must validate real logic.
- All tests must pass before a PR can be merged. Refer to the [CI-gate list in Testing Strategy](docs/testing/README.md#5-ci-gated-pipelines--enforcement-rules).

---

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled — no implicit `any`.
- NestJS conventions: one module per feature, services handle business logic, controllers handle HTTP.
- DTOs use `class-validator` decorators for input validation.
- Entities use TypeORM decorators; no raw SQL outside migrations.
- Keep services free of HTTP concerns (`HttpException` is fine, but no `Request`/`Response` imports in services).
- Stellar interactions go through `StellarService` only — never call the SDK directly from other services.
- **Import guards only from the shared barrel**: Always import guards from `@/common/guards` (or `../common/guards`) instead of module-internal paths. This prevents import path errors and ensures consistency across the codebase.

  ```typescript
  // ✅ Correct
  import { RolesGuard, JwtAuthGuard, OptionalJwtGuard } from '@/common/guards';

  // ❌ Incorrect
  import { RolesGuard } from '../auth/guards/roles.guard';
  import { OptionalJwtGuard } from '../auth/optional-jwt.guard';
  ```

### Logging Conventions

The project uses structured logging with `nestjs-pino` for better observability and debugging:

- **Use PinoLogger**: Inject `PinoLogger` instead of NestJS `Logger` in all services
- **Set context**: Always call `this.logger.setContext(ServiceName.name)` in constructors
- **Structured data**: Use objects for log data, strings for messages:

  ```ts
  // Good
  this.logger.info(
    { userId, dealId, amount },
    "Investment created successfully",
  );

  // Bad
  this.logger.info(
    `Investment created for user ${userId} deal ${dealId} amount ${amount}`,
  );
  ```

- **Log levels**:
  - `info`: Normal operations (deal created, payment processed)
  - `warn`: Recoverable issues (retry attempts, validation warnings)
  - `error`: Failures that require attention (Stellar errors, database failures)
- **Correlation IDs**: All logs automatically include correlation IDs for request tracing
- **No console.log**: Never use `console.log` in service files — always use the injected logger

### OpenAPI Specification

The API specification is generated from NestJS route decorators and lives in `backend/openapi.json`. This file is committed to the repo and verified in CI.

**After modifying API routes or DTOs, regenerate the spec:**

```bash
cd backend && node generate-openapi.js
```

Commit the updated `openapi.json` with your changes. PRs that modify routes/DTOs without regenerating the spec will fail CI with a spec drift error.

**Why**: The spec must always match the deployed routes. CI compares the generated spec against the committed version on all PRs — if they differ, the PR is blocked until you regenerate and commit the spec.

Run the linter before committing:

```bash
cd backend && npm run lint
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Make sure all tests pass: `npm test`
2. Make sure the linter is clean: `npm run lint`
3. Open a PR against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why.
4. Reference any related spec task (e.g. `Implements task 4.1 from .kiro/specs/agric-onchain-finance/tasks.md`).
5. PRs require at least one review before merging.

---

## First Contribution Journey

Use this short path to get oriented before taking a first issue:

1. Choose a module: `backend/` owns the NestJS API, persistence, queues, and Stellar integrations; `frontend/` owns the Next.js user experience and API clients; `blockchain/` owns Soroban contracts and deployment scripts.
2. Start with an issue labeled **good first issue** for a bounded, well-described entry point. **help wanted** marks work where maintainers are actively looking for outside help; confirm the intended approach in the issue before starting.
3. Create a focused branch from `main` using the branch conventions above. Keep the change within the issue's module unless the issue explicitly requires a cross-module change.
4. Run the relevant checks before opening a PR: `cd backend && npm test && npm run lint`, `cd frontend && npm test`, or `cd blockchain && cargo test` for contract changes.
5. Open a PR against `main` that links the issue, explains the user-facing or technical outcome, and notes the checks you ran. CI runs after the PR opens; address its feedback, then request review. At least one approval is required before merge.

For deeper context, read the [project overview](./README.md), [production-readiness guide](./docs/production-readiness.md), [Stellar contract guide](./blockchain/SOROBAN_DEVELOPMENT.md), and [incident-response runbook](./docs/runbooks/incident-response.md). Ask questions on the issue first so the decision stays visible to future contributors; use a new issue when no existing one fits.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

Agri-Fi maintains a strict log of Architecture Decision Records in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/README.md).

Whenever you submit a Pull Request that introduces or alters significant architectural patterns (e.g. state persistence, ledger interaction models, queue message encryption, security RLS boundaries, or key management):

1. **Mandatory Requirement:** You MUST include a new ADR document based on [`docs/adr/ADR-000-template.md`](./docs/adr/ADR-000-template.md).
2. Document the context, decision outcome, trade-offs/consequences, and alternatives considered.
3. Update the index in [`docs/adr/README.md`](./docs/adr/README.md).

---

## Architecture Notes

- **PostgreSQL** is the source of truth for application state.
- **Stellar** is the source of truth for payment finality — always verify on-chain before updating DB status.
- **RabbitMQ** handles all async Stellar jobs (asset issuance, escrow release). Never submit Stellar transactions synchronously in a request handler.
- **Escrow secret keys** are stored encrypted at rest using AES-256. Never log or expose them.
- All Stellar interactions target **testnet** during development. Switch to mainnet by setting `STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet` and updating `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL`.
- The `StellarService` is a global NestJS provider — inject it wherever blockchain operations are needed.
