# Agri-fi

![Docker Security Scan](https://github.com/agri-fi/agri-fi/actions/workflows/docker-scan.yml/badge.svg)

Creates a trade deal for agricultural produce (e.g. 10 tons of cocoa) and uploads supporting documents
2. The platform issues a **Stellar asset** (Trade_Token) representing fractional ownership — each token = $100 USD
3. **Investors** fund the deal by purchasing tokens; funds are held in a **Stellar escrow account**
4. The trader records **shipment milestones** (Farm → Warehouse → Port → Importer) on-chain
5. When the `Importer` milestone is confirmed, escrow is automatically released: farmer gets 98%, investors get their proportional share, platform takes 2%

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- Docker + Docker Compose
- A [Stellar testnet keypair](https://laboratory.stellar.org) funded via [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org)

### 1. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Fill in JWT_SECRET, STELLAR_PLATFORM_SECRET, and other required values
```

### 3. Install dependencies and run migrations

```bash
cd backend && npm install && npm run migration:run
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 4. Start the servers

```bash
# Backend — http://localhost:3001
cd backend && npm run start:dev

# Frontend — http://localhost:3000
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## User roles

- **Farmer** — lists produce, receives payment on delivery
- **Trader** — creates trade deals, manages shipments
- **Investor** — funds deals by purchasing Trade_Tokens, earns returns on completion

All users must complete KYC before participating in trade deals or investments.

---

## Stellar integration

- Each trade deal gets a unique **issuer keypair** and **escrow account** on Stellar testnet
- Trade_Tokens are Stellar custom assets (e.g. `COCOA1002`) minted to the escrow account
- Document hashes and shipment milestones are anchored on-chain via Stellar memo transactions
- Escrow release is a single multi-operation transaction: farmer payment + investor distributions + platform fee
- All Stellar operations are async via RabbitMQ with up to 3 retries on failure

> All blockchain interactions target **Stellar testnet** by default. Set `STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet` to switch.

---

## Testing

```bash
cd backend && npm test
```

The backend uses **Jest** for unit tests and **fast-check** for property-based tests. Key correctness properties verified:

- Token count = `floor(total_value / 100)`
- Sum of confirmed investments = `total_invested`
- Investments never exceed `total_value`
- Farmer + investors + platform fee = `total_value`
- Platform fee = `total_value * 0.02`
- Milestones always follow the sequence: Farm → Warehouse → Port → Importer

### Load & Performance Testing
Performance benchmarks and stress tests are automated with **k6**. See the **[Load Testing Guide](docs/testing/load-testing.md)** for scenario details, latency thresholds (p95 budgets), reading test output, and CI gating.

## Security & Hardening

Platform defensive controls, verification procedures, and monitoring coverage are tracked in the **[Security Hardening Checklist](docs/security/hardening.md)**.
- **Implemented Controls**: Row-Level Security (RLS), ClamAV virus scanning, rate limiting/throttling, helmet security headers, AES-256 envelope encryption, audit interceptor, DNS rebinding defense, and multi-sig escrow wallets.
- **Threat Mapping**: Mapped against the OWASP Top 10 and SRIOT supply chain threat models.
